1. Overfitted model - Line cutting all point (a)

2. The model that best minimizes training error is the one that will perform best for the task of prediction on new data.
	
	- False (Model that best minimizes testing data error)

3. The following table illustrates the results of evaluating 4 models with different parameter choices on some data set. Which of the following models fits this data the best?
	
	- Model 3. Models fits this data the best is model with the Smallest RSS (Residual sum of squares)

4. Assume we fit the following quadratic function: f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) to the dataset shown (blue circles). The fitted function is shown by the green curve in the picture below. Out of the 3 parameters of the fitted function (w0, w1, w2), which ones are estimated to be 0? 
	
	- W2, f(x) = w0+w1x+w2(x^2) with total linear regression line. w2 will be zero then it will be in form y=x+c.

5. Assume we fit the following quadratic function: f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) to the dataset shown (blue circles). The fitted function is shown by the green curve in the picture below. Out of the 3 parameters of the fitted function (w0, w1, w2), which ones are estimated to be 0? 
	
	- W0 and W2, f(x) = w0+w1x+w2(x^2) with total linear regression line and go through (0,0). w0 and w2 will be zero.

6. Assume we fit the following quadratic function: f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) to the dataset shown (blue circles). The fitted function is shown by the green curve in the picture below. Out of the 3 parameters of the fitted function (w0, w1, w2), which ones are estimated to be 0?
	
	- None of the above. f(x) = w0+w1x+w2(x^2) with quardrtic curve. None of the w will be zero

7. Assume we fit the following quadratic function: f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) to the dataset shown (blue circles). The fitted function is shown by the green curve in the picture below. Out of the 3 parameters of the fitted function (w0, w1, w2), which ones are estimated to be 0? 
	- W0, f(x) = w0+w1x+w2(x^2) with quadratic curve and go through (0,0) so w0 will be zero

8. Which of the following plots would you not expect to see as a plot of training and test error curves?
	- a. because training error continue to decrease and test error first decrease and then increase. Should have same behaviour.

9. One always prefers to use a model with more features since it better captures the true underlying process.
	- False as some features may be inter-dependent on each other and including will result in error. One should be selective in choosing the features.
